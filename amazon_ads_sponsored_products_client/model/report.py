Keyword search term reports only return search terms that have generated at least one click or sale.  **Note**: Search term reports for auto-targeted campaigns created before 11/14/2018 can be accessed from the `/v2/sp/keywords/report` resource. Search term reports for auto-targeted campaigns generated on-and-after 11/14/2018 can be accessed from the `/v2/sp/targets/report` resource.   | Dimension | Valid report types | Description | |-----------|-------------|-------------| | query | keywords, targets | Segments a report based on customer search term. | | placement | campaigns | Segments a `campaigns` report based on the page location where the ad appeared. |.
